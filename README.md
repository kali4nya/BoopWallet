# BoopWallet 💼🔐

**BoopWallet** is an open-source cryptocurrency wallet *aiming* to be secure, cross-platform, and user-friendly. It's written in **C#** using **Avalonia UI**, which *should* make it compatible with **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** — tested only on windows tho (for now) 🤷‍♂️

## 🧪 Status: Very Much a Work in Progress

Right now, BoopWallet is still under development. That means:

- Things might break 🧨  
- A lot of features are missing 🕳️  
- Security is the *intention*, not the guarantee (yet) 🧐
- It's more of a look into my work than actuall application yet 🤡

## 🔐 Security Goals (Eventually™)

- 🧂 **Argon2** is used for password hashing — resistant to brute force and designed for secure key derivation.
- 🔐 **AES-256** encryption is used for storing private keys and addresses.
